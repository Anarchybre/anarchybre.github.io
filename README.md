## Introduction

This showcase is a sandbox allowing to test different web technologies, it gathers various works and concepts. It is not intended to be embedded in a native application. 

## Timeline

### Objective

The objective here is to make this website as light as possible and not to use any framework. I said framework, don't panic buddy I will not reinvent the wheel.
* Frameworks pass but languages remain. Never forget that.
* "Back to the roots" is my favorite quote
* Clearly, it wouldn't be fun without a challenge.

So, all you need is your browser.
  
*PS : if you use IE6 I can't help you anymore, you're probably lost in a parallel world.*
  
### Next steps

* Release 1 - Structure
* **Release 2 - Links + Responsive :fire:**
* Release 3 - Clicklistener on buttons (Visitor challenge 1)
* Release 4 - Create WS + Heroku hosting

## Tools
